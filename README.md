This repository contains the code for an image classification project using the InceptionV3 model. This model is trained to differentiate between two classes of images.

    Project Goals:
Develop a model to accurately classify images into two categories.
Utilize data augmentation techniques to improve model performance.

    Target Audience
This project is intended for:
>Machine learning enthusiasts interested in image classification.
>Researchers working on developing deep learning models for medical diagnosis.
>People who drives alo , specially in nights.
